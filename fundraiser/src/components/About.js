// //         <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
// //         <p>
// //           Mazingira addresses the pressing issue of environmental degradation, which poses a significant threat to our planet. Environmental degradation encompasses the deterioration of the earth's natural resources, including air, water, soil, and habitats, leading to the loss of biodiversity and endangering ecosystems worldwide. The lack of sustainable practices and resources exacerbates this problem, threatening the well-being of current and future generations.
// //         </p>
// //         <p>
// //           Furthermore, traditional funding models for environmental conservation efforts often fall short in meeting the escalating demands for urgent action. Many environmental organizations struggle to secure consistent funding, hindering their ability to implement long-term solutions and respond effectively to environmental challenges. Thus, there is a critical need for innovative approaches to empower both organizations and individuals to contribute meaningfully to environmental preservation.
