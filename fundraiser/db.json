It is characterized as any change or aggravation to nature’s turf seen to be pernicious or undesirable. This process leads to the endangerment of the human race, however, there are limited resources to help combat this at this time. One of the ways the organization is looking to raise funds is by encouraging repeat donations. The goal would be to create a platform that allows users to donate to organizations such as this one regularly, to enable the organization to meet their goals. They are looking to create a product that automates the donation process by allowing donors to set up regular donations e.g. monthly donations of stipulated amounts."
